    // The central hub of the network is the RocketStorage contract, which is responsible for storing the state of the
    // entire protocol. This is implemented through the use of maps for key-value storage, and getter and setter methods for
    // reading and writing values for a key.
    // The RocketStorage contract also stores the addresses of all other network contracts (keyed by name),
    // and restricts data modification to those contracts only.
    // Because of Rocket Pool's architecture, the addresses of other contracts should not be used directly but retrieved
    // from the blockchain before use. Network upgrades may have occurred since the previous interaction, resulting in
    // outdated addresses. RocketStorage can never change address, so it is safe to store a reference to it.
